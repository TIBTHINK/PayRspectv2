# PayRespectV2

This is the same [plugin](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/bukkit-plugins/payrespect) but updated to the latest version with a extra command I thought would be fitting, 

## What does this plugin do?

Quite simply, it sends a console message whenever a player has the misfortune of dying. 

## What is new?

Other than being updated to the latest version, I have added a command that is the same as /kill but with a more depressing name.

## Commands:

Test: makes sure the plugin is working properly

Freedom: kills the player who issued the command

FiringSquad: kills every player who is logged into the server
