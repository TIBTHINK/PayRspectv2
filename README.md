# PayRespectV2


This is the same plugin but updated to the latest version with a extra command I thought would be fitting, 


## What does this plugin do?


Quite simply, it sends a console message whenever a player has the misfortune of dying. 


## What is new?


Other than being updated to the latest version, I have added a command that is the same as /kill but with a more depressing name.


## Commands:


Test: makes sure the plugin is working properly

Freedom: kills the player who issued the command

FiringSquad: kills everyone with a countdown

DeathCount: shows the player how many times they have died

DeathLeaderboard: gives the top ten deaths in the server

payrespect version: checks for any updates
